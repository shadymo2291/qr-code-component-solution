### What I learned

in this project i used some CSS properties to help for responsive font size, such as @media

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

section .text p:nth-child(1) {
font-size: 20px;
font-weight: 700;
color: var(--p_bigger-color);
margin-top: 10px;
}
@media (max-width: 768px) {
section .text p:nth-child(1) {
font-size: 25px;
}
}

### Continued development

I want to learn more about responsive websites.
